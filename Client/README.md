Healthbridge

Project Description

Product Vision
To bridge the gap between underserved communities and quality healthcare. We are  building an open-source platform that makes it easy for anyone to find nearby providers, see upfront costs, schedule appointments, and share honest feedback.
Itâ€™s about transparency, accessibility, and giving people the tools they need to take charge of their health.



Problem Statement
In many low-income and underserved communities, finding nearby healthcare providers, understanding the cost of services, and scheduling appointments remain significant challenges. According to the World Bank, only 43% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa has access to basic healthcare services. This lack of accessibility and transparency often leads to delayed care, worsening health outcomes, and increased financial burdens. For instance, studies reveal that 33% of patients in rural areas forgo or delay care due to transportation challenges, while 40% of patients cite financial constraints as a key barrier. Patients are left navigating a fragmented system with little to no clarity, making it harder to trust or engage with available healthcare options. There is an urgent need for a solution that simplifies access, provides cost transparency, and empowers individuals to take control of their health while ensuring accountability in care delivery.

Solution
Healthbridge is a web-based healthcare platform that bridges the gap between patients and healthcare providers, tailored to the unique needs of low-income and underserved communities.
